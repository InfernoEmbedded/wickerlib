# KiCad Teensy LC Project

This is a KiCad template to make it easy to include the Teensy LC in a project. 

This template comes preset for the OSH Park design rules.

### Usage

This is the blank template. You will be able to download the <a href="https://github.com/wickerbox/wickerlib/blob/master/templates/teensy-lc/teensy-lc-template.zip?raw=true">zip file</a> containing the project and libraries.

To use the template:

1. Download and extract the zip into a folder.
1. Rename all the files to replace `teensy-lc` with your filename. 
1. Open the project file in KiCad.
1. Add your libraries, add your parts, wire them up.
1. When you're ready to start layout, create the new netlist. 
1. Go to PCBNew and import the new netlist. 
1. Delete the silk note and silk text if you want. The silk is not a part of the footprint. 
1. Lay out your board! The footprint is already in place, but it is not locked so you can move it around. 
1. Draw the board outline on the Edge Cuts layer.
1. You can upload the .kicad_pcb file directly to oshpark.com to check the preview images.

### Test Board

I've included the example project I created to verify the footprint. It doesn't include any routing and probably isn't useful.
