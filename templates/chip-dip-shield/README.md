# KiCad DIP Template for the C.H.I.P Computer

This is a KiCad template to simplify making DIP daughter boards (wings, shields, hats, etc.) 

It comes preset for the OSH Park design rules.

### Usage

This is the blank template. You can download the zip file containing the project and libraries here.

To use the template:

1. Download and extract the zip into a folder.
1. Rename all the files to replace `chip-dip-blank` with your filename. 
1. Open the project file in KiCad.
1. Add your libraries, add your parts, wire them up.
1. When you're ready to start layout, create the new netlist. 
1. Go to PCBNew and import the new netlist. 
1. Lay out your board! The existing headers are locked in place, so don't try to move them.
1. You can upload the .kicad_pcb file directly to oshpark.com to check the preview images.

### CHIP DIP Protoboard Example

Using the blank template, I followed those steps to create an empty protoboard, which is available <a href="https://github.com/wickerbox/Protoboard-DIP-for-CHIP">in its own repo here</a>.
