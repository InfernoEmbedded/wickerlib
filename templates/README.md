# KiCad Templates

KiCad templates are projects with design rules, layer views, libraries, and page settings already in place. I've created templates for my own use with wickerlib, but I've also created the OSH Park 2-layer and 4-layer templates that incorporate OSH Park's design rules.

- Teensy 3.2 Footprint
