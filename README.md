# wickerlib
Collection of open source parts, circuits, and templates for KiCad.

Wickerlib is a part of my quest to turn around projects as quickly and with as little uncertainty as possible. I haven't seen a lot of people in the hobbyist and independent consultant Maker world talking about KiCad and circuit design infrastructure, so I figured the information might be valuable.
