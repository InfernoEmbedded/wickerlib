# Reference Circuits

This is a collection of KiCad projects containing breakout boards that will be or have been designed, laid out, assembled, and tested. 

To use the schematic circuit of any of these projects, just copy the .sch file into your project folder and tell KiCad where to find it by adding a hierarchical sheet with the same name inside your project. 

All the work here is released under the CERN Open Hardware License v1.2.
